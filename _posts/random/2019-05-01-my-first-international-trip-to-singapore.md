Being an Indian, this was my first ever international travel to another country. I had never traveled alone so far. But, this 10-day trip to Singapore was an unforgettable experience in my life.

> This is my first ever travelogue in this website. So, please pardon me if you find my writing vague.

In this travelogue, I will discuss about the overall expenses incurred for this 10-day trip, places I visited, places I missed, my photography toolkit, food that is available for vegetarians like me and about the city in general.

### Flight Expenses
I planned and booked tickets well before four months of my journey. I chose [INDIGO](https://www.goindigo.in/){:target="_blank"} flights as I have traveled before (domestic) and also, I'm a happy INDIGO customer. Below are the expenses incurred for departure and arrival of my travel.
* Chennai to Singapore (17 April 2019) - INR 7,699 (Economy)
* Singapore to Chennai (28 April 2019) - INR 10,725 (Economy)

These do not include any meal and I wasn't choosy about my seat number either. If you need these, then your fare amount increases as per your liking.

Things you need to carry during these flight travel are 
* Your Passport (must)
* Your Visa to Singapore (must)
* Any of your Identity Card (not mandatory, but good to keep)

Documents you need to get Singapore Visa are
* Your Passport
* Bank payslips for past 3 months
* Bank statement for past 90 days
* Passport of someone you know in Singapore
* V39A form from someone you know in Singapore
* Office ID card
* Minimum Bank Balance (INR 80,000)
* Passport Size Photo of You (Singapore specific)

<h3 id="my-photography-toolkit">My Photography Toolkit</h3>

If you love photography like me, Singapore has got numerous photographic locations in this planet. It is rich in dense forests with neat trails at day and rich in beautiful lights and colors shining throughout the city at night. My photography toolkit comprises the below stuff.
* Canon EOS 700D
* Canon EF-S55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM lens
* Canon EF50mm F/1.8 STM lens
* Canon EF-S 18â€“55mm lens

If you are planning to visit Singapore Zoo or Night Safari or River Safari, make sure you carry a telephoto zoom lens such as [Canon EF-S55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM lens](https://www.amazon.in/EF-S-55-250mm-f-4-5-6-STM/dp/B00EP71ETU){:target="_blank"} with you.
