Being an Indian, this was my first ever international travel to another country. I had never traveled alone so far. But, this 10-day trip to Singapore was an unforgettable experience in my life.

> This is my first ever travelogue in this website. So, please pardon me if you find my writing vague.

In this travelogue, I will cover the overall expenses incurred for this 10-day trip, places I visited, places I missed, food that is available for vegetarians like me and about the city in general.

### Flight Expenses
I planned and booked tickets well before four months of my journey. I chose [INDIGO](https://www.goindigo.in/){:target="_blank"} flights as I have traveled before (domestic) and also, I'm a happy INDIGO customer. Below are the expenses incurred for departure and arrival of my travel.
* Chennai to Singapore (17 April 2019) - <span class="coding">INR 7,699</span> (Economy)
* Singapore to Chennai (28 April 2019) - <span class="coding">INR 10,725</span> (Economy)

These do not include any meal and I wasn't choosy about my seat number either. If you need these, then your fare amount increases as per your liking.

Things you need to carry during these flight travel are 
* Your Passport (must)
* Your Visa to Singapore (must)
* Any of your Identity Card (not mandatory, but good to keep)

Documents you need to get Singapore Visa are
* Your Passport
* Bank payslips for past 3 months
* Bank statement for past 90 days
* Passport of someone you know in Singapore
* V39A form from someone you know in Singapore
* Office ID card
* Minimum Bank Balance (<span class="coding">INR 80,000</span>)
* Passport Size Photo of You (Singapore specific)
